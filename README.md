# OpenCV-projects
Set of mini projects I did using an OpenCV , an image processing library in python

## Implementing Kalman Filter using opencv 
Skills : Probablistic robotics - recursive state estimation using a parametric filter known as extended kalman filter , image processing using opencv 

This deserves its own github page , hence here is the link : https://github.com/ayush-agarwal-0502/Kalman-filter-using-opencv
